## Technical Considerations

### State Management Strategy
- **Zustand** for global state (auth, cart, settings)
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Hook Form** for form state
- **Local Storage** for persistence

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Materialized views for complex reports
- Partitioning for large transaction tables
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations

### Security Measures
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens
- Rate limiting

### Performance Targets
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- Transaction processing: < 1 second
- Search queries: < 500ms
- Report generation: < 5 seconds
- Database queries: < 100ms average

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with Supabase local setup
